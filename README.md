Mobile App Development Project
Summary of the App
This app was developed to help users manage inventory items efficiently. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete items, addressing the need for an intuitive way to organize and track inventory. It was designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for users to interact with the features without unnecessary complications.

User-Centered UI Design
The app includes the following screens and features to meet user needs:

Input Fields: For adding item names and quantities.
RecyclerView: To display the list of inventory items dynamically.
Buttons: For adding, updating, and deleting inventory items.
The UI design kept users in mind by ensuring clean layouts, clear input fields, and accessible buttons. These designs were successful because they provided an intuitive experience that minimized the learning curve.
Coding Approach
I started coding the app by breaking it into smaller tasks, like setting up the database, creating the UI, and linking user interactions to database functions. I used strategies like modular code design and frequent testing after each feature implementation. These techniques helped ensure that each part of the app worked as expected and could be easily debugged. These strategies will be useful in future projects to maintain a structured workflow.

Testing and Debugging
I tested the app using the Android Emulator to verify the functionality of each feature. This included ensuring that items were correctly added, updated, deleted, and displayed in the RecyclerView. Testing is important because it ensures reliability and reveals issues early. For example, testing helped identify bugs in database operations, which I resolved to ensure the app worked smoothly.

Challenges and Innovations
One challenge was ensuring the app stored and retrieved data properly from the SQLite database. I had to innovate by carefully designing the database schema and writing efficient methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Debugging these processes taught me a lot about database handling in mobile apps.

Key Successes
The most successful component of the app was the seamless integration of SQLite with the RecyclerView. This demonstrated my ability to combine user-centered design with technical skills, ensuring both functionality and usability.
